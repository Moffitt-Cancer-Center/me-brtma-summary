\title{Find min/max ordinal level in vector}
\usage{
find_level(x, f = min)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector representing ordinal values}

\item{f}{A function (min, max) to use against ordinal values}
}
\value{
A character vector representing the max/min ordinal value in \code{x}
}
\description{
Returns the minimum (or maximum) ordinal level present in the vector
}
\details{
Factors generally are numerical values representing specific strings that
are expected to be repeated in a vector (see iris$Species for instance). Ordinal factors
are factors that have an ordering imposed by the levels specified in the factor (see
\code{\link[=levels]{levels()}}).

This function determines, for a vector, what the smallest (or largest) ordinal factor
is. In a vector it is not required that all ordinal values are present. This function
will return the factor level of the smallest value (or largest value) in the vector.
